## Proposal name:
feedweave-improvement

## Summary:
[FEEDweave](https://feedweave.co) is an MVP decentralized social network built on top of Arweave that needs more functionality.

## Motivation:
The goal of FEEDweave is to demonstate the power of Arweave as a backend for decentralized social applications.

FEEDweave aims to be a community-built application and leverage the open, permissionless 
nature of Arweave to encourage ecosystem participants to contribute to building it out.

FEEDweave has been architected from composable components that can be reused by other applications on top of Arweave. 

The goal of FEEDweave is to both serve as a fully functioning social network for early adopters in the Arweave community,
the broader crypto community, and eventually mainstream users.

Components built for FEEDweave will serve as a demonstration of how to build other applications similar to it on top of Arweave.
