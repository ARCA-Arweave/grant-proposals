Proposal name: PermaSnap
Authors : Vilenarious, Benji, Ros
Summary:
Create and publish a simple, easy to use mobile app for seamlessly uploading photos to the Arweave permaweb.

Motivation:
The goal of this project is to build a minimum viable product for an Android, iOS, & PWA mobile application, PermaSnap. This app has several goals that relate to core goals of ARCA.

Raise awareness of Arweave via an easy to use and understand mobile app. Directly increase network transactions and data as users store valuable, permanent photos. Increase demand for Arweave token.

Specification:
In order for a minimum viable product to be effective, it must offer a complete, single, end to end use case. The first use case that will be built against is for uploading photos from an iOS or Android device to Arweave.

Example use cases:
Permanent Uncensorable Content
A protester is at a rally, and takes a photo of police acting unfairly to other citizens. The protester snaps the photo and hits send to Arweave. The PermaSnap app interface opens up, asks for a tag, displays the cost of transaction and confirms the user wants to permanently publish this photo to the decentralized perma web. The protester agrees and ensures this moment is never lost.

Viewing Scope : Public Content Encrypted : No

Personal Photo Album
Viewing Scope : Private Content Encrypted : Yes

A mother records a video of her toddler taking his first steps. Then hits "Share" and posts it to her facebook wall so her friends can see it or twitter/other social networks. Here the photo is saved to the encrypted and saved to the Arweave.

However, the app should be simple enough to use and understand so that anyone with the need to permanently store a photo can pick it up and use it.

To accomplish this, the mobile app must
Be allowed into the iOS or Android store. Be simple and easy to use with as few clicks as possible. Allow the user to upload a photo from their gallery. Estimate and submit transactions to the Arweave network.

At this time, in order to release a minimum viable product in a timely fashion, the application would be free and funded via a central wallet. To prevent abuse, the app should only allow one picture every 5 minutes (for example) until a decentralized payment approach is integrated.

Another approach could have a daily limit per user.

Additional features can be added to increase adoption, usability and decentralization.
Let the user create and fund an AR wallet in the app instead of central wallet. Allow the user to watch advertisements to fund their AR wallet. Display, sort and filter the user’s previously submitted photos. Include sharing features like post to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, other decentralized social networks etc. Include metrics to capture usage. Use ARCA standard Arweave node and gateway. User Interface improvements based on feedback.

The above features should be seen as a bonus, and not required for the minimum viable product.

Components:
The following milestones will be considered key deliverables. When combined, they will make the PermaSnap minimum viable product. Each milestone will have a corresponding cost and responsible party. All code must be hosted in the ARCA GitHub. Application Core Develop a cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile application that pulls a photo from an iOS or Android device, estimates cost, and submits to the server / arweave network. On first run of the app, the app creates an Arweave private/public key. Backend Server Posts files to the Arweave on behalf of users. Consists of an interface for controlling the arweave wallet. Rate limiting functions. Basic Database. Health monitoring functionality Application Interface Wrap PermaSnap core with a simple, modern interface. App Testing Best effort testing of the application on the latest version of iOS is required. Functional and security related issues must be resolved.

App Store Publication
ARCA will be responsible for publishing this application into the App Store and pay all fees at this time. It is recommended that the application is free until payment mechanisms are built into the app.

Team and previous work:
The following ARCA members will be responsible for this proposal and deliver the minimum viable product of PermaSnap.

Lead and Project Manager: Vilenarios UI/Mockups: Benji Android Mobile Dev: Ros / Benji Backend : Benji iOS Mobile Dev: Benji (can handle platform specific tweaks / bugs.. Code Reviews) Arweave Dev: Ros Testing: Vilenarios Marketing / Adoption: TBA

Risks:
The following are key risks that could adversely impact the project timeline and cost. Arweave updates may cause issues with PermaSnap integration. Arweave 2 is on the horizon, and things may have to be rewritten. Not being allowed to publish the app to the app store due to this being a cryptocurrency related application.

Timeline:
It is estimated that building the Perma Snap minimum viable product to take a full duration of 2 months with the below estimates for individual milestones.

Application & Server Build -> 1 month Application Testing and remediation -> 2 weeks Application Release -> 2 weeks

Additionally, it is recommended that ARCA build and host an Arweave Gateway server to support PermaSnap. However, the scope and effort for this is not contained within this proposal.

Marketing / Adoption:
Marketing & Adoption will be handled in a third stage (the first two dedicated to development), which will be outlined with more definition in a later document.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of worthwhile undertakings :

Active Twitter Account
Daily Prizes for best photo (picked by community or ARCA)
Event outreach - is there something going on in the world worth recording ? Permasnap twitter can get involved in activee topics on these events and invite people to use the platform.
Website / SEO - a one pager to drive users to the app.
Integration with other platforms (Wordpress etc)
