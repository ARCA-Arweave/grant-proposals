**Development** <br>
Project bootstrapping, and Arweave dapp data-model level decisions that need to be made for the form posting / viewing elements of the website.

Forms will be posted using DPOST

Website Development will be done in Gatsby, Svelte or similar, pending a proper deep-dive into those libraries.

Website Build-out, styling etc will be put on Gitcoin as a bounty.

## Brand

#### Color<br>

## Website Design<br>
The website will initially be a one page design displaying the following information in an interesting & engaging way.<br>
A minimal, clean design will be requested.<br>

## Initial Features<br>
Team Roster<br> *An introduction to the members of ARCA*
Projects<br> *detailed list of the projects ARCA has funded, each project will have its own page Permasnap, Feedweave, Gateway*
Tooling<br> *A detailed list of the various tooling projects which ARCA has funded DPOST (part of permasnap so far), Reverse DNS*
Membership & Grant Forms (can be posted to Arweave using DPOST, with some modifications.)<br>
Social media / GitHub links.<br>
Mission/Vision of ARCA<br>
<br>

## Integrations
1. Health check of perma.online<br>
On the website landing there'll be a small colored circle for ARCA GATEWAY reflecting the node status. Clicking on this will bring the user to the Gateway page for a deeper drill down on metrics & project history.<br>

2. DPOST (Delegated Posting, allows a user to 'delegate' posting of a transaction to arweave to a third party while still being able to prove ownership of the transaction.) <br>
Permasnap development has laid some good foundations for this - some modifications will need to be made to the code for it to work with other Arweave Apps. These modifications are included in the budget (Benji) <br>
Modifications needed are : generalisation of code to accomodate any arweave app, currently it's got permasnap-specific references which will need to be changed.

3. Forms
Membership + Grant Application forms will be built & use ARweave as a backend. These forms will use DPOST.

## Timeline<br>
3 weeks for designs.<br>
Initial project bootstrapping and data-design can be done concurrently.<br>
