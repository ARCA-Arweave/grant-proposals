## Proposal name:
Admin role for ARCA

## Summary:
Admin will handle the onboarding of new members and the continuity of granted projects.

## Motivation:
ARCA is a community-governed DAO that is aiming to expand the Arweave ecosystem, project, and network. It was launched 3 months ago, and the members came to the conclusion that an admin role will be necessary for its development.

## Specification:

1st axis: ARCA Members
	•	Maintaining the membership application survey including distributing results to ARCA
	•	Increasing the reach of the grant application process/be present on other online communities
	•	Responding to, encouraging & helping potential applicants in #arca-dao
	•	Organizing the new member meetings with ARCA
	•	Onboarding the new members to the discord
	•	Creating the necessary onboarding materials and votes for new members
	•	Mentoring new members and advising on what their first steps in the DAO should be (finding/creating initiatives to engage with)
	•	Managing ARCA Roster list and adding/removing members as needed
	•	Examining participation metrics to determine inactive members once a month
  
2nd axis: Granted projects
	•	Organize discussions and launch voting when the DAO has enough elements
	•	Follow-up with granted projects/drafting reports about them
	•	Bridge between ARCA and AR for project directions
  
What should not be included in this role: is the decision process regarding adding new members, deciding on vote to be started or not and ARCA communications.
